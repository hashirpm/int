##Problem Statement
Launch a token with a chain of your choice with a fixed supply and a notional value. 

## Inspiration
In this current scenario, when the attention has shifted away from the energy-intensive bitcoin blockchain to the ethereum blockchain, allowing traders to lend their ETH holdings and earn interest on the same will be welcoming.
 
##Important Values
Total Token Supply: **1000000000**

Value of Token: **0.001 ETH**

InterestPerSecond = 31668017 * (etherBalanceOf[msg.sender] / 1e16)

## What it does
Our project allows traders to lend their ethereum holdings and earn interest on the same.
Deposits are made in the form of Ether.
The interest is given in the form of INT interest token, based on the formula:
**interestPerSecond = 31668017 * (etherBalanceOf[msg.sender] / 1e16)**

## How we built it
Using Solidity.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We could make a complete working model.
